# Week 3: Task Management System - Planning and Database Design

## Overview
Week 3 marked the beginning of the main project. The focus shifted from practice to planning and building the architecture for a more complex Task Management System, including detailed database design and the creation of an admin panel.

## Work Done
*   **System Architecture:** Planned the overall structure and user roles (Admin, Project Manager, Employee) for the Task Management System, defining the permissions and capabilities for each role.
*   **Database Schema Design:** Designed a normalized database schema in MySQL. Created tables for `users`, `projects`, `tasks`, and `progress` to efficiently store and relate all necessary data.
*   **Admin Panel Development:** Built the core functionality of the Admin Panel, allowing administrators to create new user accounts, edit existing user details, and delete users from the system.
*   **Project Module Initiation:** Started developing the project management module by implementing CRUD operations for projects, enabling their creation and management.
*   **Dashboard Layout:** Created a homepage layout to display key information such as recent tasks and overall project status, providing a quick overview for users.

## Outcome
Laid the critical foundation for the Task Management System by designing a robust database and building the essential administrative backend features, setting the stage for the core task management functionality.
