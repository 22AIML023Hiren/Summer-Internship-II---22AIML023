# Week 1: Environment Setup and PHP Fundamentals

## Overview
The first week focused on establishing a strong foundation for web development. I configured the necessary local development environment and dedicated time to understanding core PHP concepts and database connectivity, which are essential for building dynamic web applications.

## Work Done
*   **Studied PHP Syntax:** Learned the fundamentals of PHP as a server-side scripting language, including variables, data types, control structures, and functions.
*   **Configured Local Environment:** Successfully installed and set up XAMPP to create a local server environment with Apache, PHP, and MySQL integration.

*   **Form Handling:** Implemented basic HTML forms and processed them using PHP, utilizing both GET and POST methods to handle user input.
*   **Session Management:** Explored the use of PHP sessions and cookies to create a simple login system, understanding how to maintain user state across different pages.

## Outcome
This week provided the crucial groundwork in PHP programming and environment setup, preparing me for the practical application development tasks in the following weeks.
