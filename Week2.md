# Week 2: CRUD Operations and Contact Management Application

## Overview
During the second week, I applied the foundational knowledge from Week 1 to build a complete mini-project. The goal was to implement full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, which is a cornerstone of most web applications.

## Work Done
*   **CRUD Implementation:** Practiced and implemented all four CRUD operations in PHP, creating scripts to insert, select, update, and delete records from a MySQL database.
*   **Application Development:** Designed and developed a "Person Contact Book" web application from scratch to manage contact information.
*   **Feature Integration:** The application allows users to add new contacts (with name, email, and phone number), view a list of all contacts, update existing contact details, and delete contacts.
*   **User Interface Design:** Built user-friendly web forms with validation for data input and a clean interface for displaying the contact records.
*   **Database Design:** Created and connected a MySQL database with an appropriate table structure to store the contact information securely.

## Outcome
Successfully built a functional CRUD-based application, which solidified my understanding of the interaction between a PHP frontend and a MySQL database and served as a practical precursor to the main project.
